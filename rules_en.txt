To use the application, first select the lottery (rules below), then choose how many matches you want to filter by (depending on the lottery).
After that, enter your winning numbers. You can select up to as many numbers as the lottery allows.
Clicking a selected number again will deselect it.
Finally, press the **"Submit"** button to display the historical data.

If there are no listed results and the app displays
*"You would have won in 0 draws out of 0 draws since the start of the lottery!"*,
then an error occurred during data retrieval. Please refresh the application.

If the number of draws is not zero but the list is empty, it means your selected numbers have never matched in any draw up to the current database update.

Some winning lucky numbers are the following, to check how the app should work. These will yield a non-empty list.
- Ötöslottó: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 / match count: 1
- Hatoslottó: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 / match count: 1
- Heteslottó: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 / match count: 1
